# Alpscarf

`D3-alpscarf` is a D3 package for visualizing AOI visits in augmented scarf plots.
The visualization is originally developed (but not limited) in the context of eye-tracking research.
Find more information about Alpscrf at [R-alpscarf](https://github.com/Chia-KaiYang/alpscarf) repository.

**NOTE: This project is still in development. The current version merely gives a *glimpse* of the kind of interaction in the tool.**

## Interact with Alpscarf

To experience how the interactive visualization work, here is a runnable web application on [bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/Chia-KaiYang/raw/cd34f16fd1a9df27a13a59045bd40c4d/)

## Usage

At the top of the visualization, there is a legend. Users can (de)select the AOIs of interest by clicking the key in the legend. The corresponding parts of all Alpscarf visualizations are also highlighted simultaneously. Users can click on Alpscarf (to select/deselect the AOIs of interest), as well as panning (click-and-drag), zooming (spin the wheel) and displaying tooltips (hover over).
