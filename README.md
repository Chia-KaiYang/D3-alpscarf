# alpscarf

`alpscarf` is an D3 package for visualizing AOI visits in augmented scarf plots.
The visualization is originally developed (but not limited) in the context of eye-tracking research.

While the D3 code is still under construction, the current version gives a glimps of the kind of intereaction in the tool.

## Interact with Alpscarf

To see how the visualization works, here is a runnable web application on [bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/Chia-KaiYang/raw/cd34f16fd1a9df27a13a59045bd40c4d/)

## Usage

On top there is a legend. Users can (de)select the AOI(s) of interest by clicking the items in the legend. All the corresponding parts of Alpscarf will be highlighted. Users can also directly perform the same interaction on Alpscarf.
